1. What is a blockchain?
    - p2p network of nodes that all talk to one and another
    - distributed network
    - All the nodes in the network participlate in running the network. They all contain a copy of the code on the blockchain and data on the blockchain. Data in the blockchain contained in bundles of records called blocks which are chained together.

2. What is a smart contract?
    - All the code on the blockchain is contained in smart contracts.
    - Program run on blockchain. Building block of blockchain
    - Written in Solidity
    - All the code is immutable once deployed
    - Like a microservice on blockchain

3. How the app work.
    Connect the application with a web browser and going to build a client side application in HTML and CSS and Javascript. The client application is going to talk directly to the blockchain and that's where we put our smart contract to create the todo list with an etherium smart contract written in solidity.

4. Ganache
    - Personal Blockchain: like a real blockchain where anyone an connect to it but it runs on our computer, so it's now a closed network. 

5. Truffle suite
    - Suite tools that allow us to develop test and deploy smart contract and allow us to build client side app inside our project.
